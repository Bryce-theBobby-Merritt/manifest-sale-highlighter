# One-Story-Point User Stories

Below is a very detailed, copy-paste–ready Markdown checklist of one-story-point user stories derived from the PRD. Each story is small enough to be completed in a single day or less, follows the INVEST principles, and includes clear acceptance criteria in Gherkin format. The stories are grouped by major feature (F1–F8), and each story lists:

- Priority (suggested using a simple RICE/WSJF rationale)  
- Tasks (as unchecked boxes)  
- Dependencies (if applicable)  
- Definition of Done (DoD) criteria  

A global "Definition of Done" can be found at the end of this document, along with a brief note on how these stories integrate into the overall roadmap.

# Prioritization & Roadmap Integration

Below is how these stories map to a simplified timeline (using WSJF or RICE scores, focusing on user value, time criticality, job size, etc.):

- Highest Priority:  
  - F1 (File Upload) & F2 (Data Parsing) stories – because they are required to make the product function at a basic level.  
  - F3 (Highlight & Output) – essential for immediate user value.

- Medium Priority:  
  - F4 (Downloadable Report) – increases usability but can follow core features.  
  - F5 (Completion Notifications) – important for user experience, but not as critical as core matching.

- Parallel / Additional Priority:  
  - F6 (Security) – in a real production scenario, this is crucial and often done in parallel.  
  - F7 (Performance & Scalability) – can be gradually optimized after basic functionality is in place.  
  - F8 (User Accounts & Integrations) – future-scope enhancements.

**Example Sprint Allocation**  
- Sprint 1: Address F1 & F2 stories (+ partial F3) to ensure file upload and basic matching.  
- Sprint 2: Complete F3, add F4 & F5.  
- Sprint 3: Tackle F6 & F7 (security, performance).  
- Sprint 4: Future enhancements (F8) if needed.

Use this markdown file as a copy-and-paste reference in your project management tool to track and manage these stories.
